# **v002-Rutt-Etra-Plugin**

Isadora port of the v002 Rutt Etra Plugin by vade

The original Quartz Composer plugin source code can be found at: https://github.com/v002/v002-Rutt-Etra

Vade sends all donations he receives via the v002 Rutt Etra web page to Jim’s partner Roz. . She lives on fixed income and has no surviving family to help her, so every donation made via Vade's page makes a big difference in someone’s life. (You can read more about Bill & Roz at Vade's page: http://v002.info/plugins/v002-rutt-etra/)

Please Note: this plugin code will not fully compile without the accompanying Isadora SDK.
We will be preparing that for release that archive no later than the end of June 2017, but
hopefully sooner.

Thanks for your patience!
